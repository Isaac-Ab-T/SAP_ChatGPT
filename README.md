# SAP Project For CHATGPT for Supportability
  SAPâ€™s ChatGPT for Supportability simplifies the process of addressing FAQs for
industries. It's a web-based platform developed with React JS for the frontend and a Node
server for the backend. The standout feature is the integration of text-to-speech
capabilities, allowing users to ask questions by typing or speaking.

  Conversational memory plays a pivotal role in this project. The system retains
context from previous interactions, allowing it to provide more accurate and
context-aware responses. This means that if a user asks a question related to a previous
query or conversation, the system can recall the context and provide relevant answers.
In summary, our project is designed to offer a user-friendly interface and advanced
text-to-speech integration. It empowers businesses to manage their FAQs and provides a
seamless experience for users.
